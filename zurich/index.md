Hiya!

[[Anforderungen]]

We like to code. And we prefer craftsman-style. And that's what we like to practice.

Our website is [zurich.codersonly.org](http://zurich.codersonly.org) which is where you should begin your explorations.

We are also on [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/coders-only-zurich) where events are announced and networking can take place.

The feed that is the easiest to follow is on [techup.ch](http://techup.ch/canton/ZH) with a good bunch of other fun events.

For all that and yet some more, follow and talk to us on twitter under [@CodersOnly\_ZRH](http://twitter.com/CodersOnly_ZRH).

And we're at [Cafe Bar Pl√ºsch](http://www.cafe-pluesch.ch) Thursdays, 18:00 to late, in our [Coders Weekly](http://zurich.codersonly.org/events/coders-weekly) sessions.

Hope to see you soon :)
